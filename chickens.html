            The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species,
            with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl,<sup>[1]</sup> that
            are originally from Southeastern Asia. <b>Rooster</b> or <b>cock</b> is a term for
            an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has
            been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a <b>hen</b> and a sexually
            immature female is called a <b>pullet</b>. Humans now keep chickens primarily as a
            source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they
            were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.

            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
            population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,<sup>[2]</sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are
            more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to
            chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.[citation needed]

        <p>Chickens are omnivores.[27] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for
            seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[28] or sometimes
            young mice.[29]

            The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[30] The world's
            oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.[31]

            Eggs from different breeds
            Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long
            flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs
            ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of
            the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster
            has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The
            identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development
            of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and
            female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on
            their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under
            their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the
            head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and
            combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a
            mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
            chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[32]

            Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens
            are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into
            trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to
            explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.</p>
